Here marks my first KOS post: How to land your Falcon9 booster and complete your
main objective.

Theres two common ways to do this:
1. With the long dead "NeverUnload" mod (so not really an option anymore), or
2. With the FRMS mod.

FRMS is a great solution. The only drawback is, you are only flying 1 craft at a
time. The mod saves all the craft states at seperation and when your done with
all your stages it stitches the many saves together. I want to land 2 Falcon9
cores from a heavy and watch as the center core flys in 30-45 seconds after, all
while monitoring main mission progress in map view.

We're going to learn a third way:
