I'm nearly done with the gathering of body info, by tomorrow night RSS should
be fully functional. Next up is antenna signal strength indicator under the
results tab(data currently loads but isnt processed), then the rest of the solar
systems ones by one. Planning on uploading a KoS script or 2 tomorrow as well.
Thanks for stopping by any bugs, or even styling ideas drop me an email. I
don't have a creative bone in my body. I'll gladly take your Kerbal art as
well ;)

Oh and gonna try to figure out comments tomorrow.
