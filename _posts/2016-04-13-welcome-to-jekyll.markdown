Nothing really to see here, I'm working on it. In the mean time check out the
satellite calculator if you use remotetech. I'm working on RSS/RO support,
currently the RSS bodies are just renamed stock bodies. Soon. Adding antenna
info right after that. Please, if you find any bugs shoot me an email. Enjoy.
