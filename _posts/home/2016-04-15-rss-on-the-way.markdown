So... the "Real Solar System" datafile is built, not super confident about it.
Think the math might be off a smidge somewhere. Please test it outside of your
normal save file. The time period section definitely seems wonky, so try to keep
by altitude until I can work that out. Again, any bugs please shoot me an email.

And the disclaimer once more:
I don't play RSS (yet) so I HAVE NOT TESTED THE RSS MATHS.

[Enjoy](/calc/)
